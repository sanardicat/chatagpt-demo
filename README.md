# OpenAI API Quickstart modified - Python example app with extension beyond pet names

This is an extended version of the Open AI animal name generator example. Very simple toy adjusted to answer ANY prompt (and has a stylish HTML gui with a wild car :-))))))) 

## Setup

1. Clone this repository

4. Create a new virtual environment

   ```bash
   $ python -m venv venv
   $ . venv/bin/activate
   ```

5. Install the requirements

   ```bash
   $ pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

6. Make a copy of the example environment variables file

   ```bash
   $ cp .env.example .env
   ```

7. Add your [API key](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys) to the newly created `.env` file

8. Run the app

   ```bash
   $ flask run
   ```

You should now be able to access the app at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)!
